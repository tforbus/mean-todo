# MEAN stack Todo list.

This is todo list application used as a tutorial for illustrating how to 
create a MEAN stack application.

I structured this project in the same way a larger project might be structured. 
Normally you probably wouldn't write such a small app this way.

## To run
```
npm install
node app
```

## Todo
- User authentication / authorization
